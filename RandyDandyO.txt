Now we are ready to sail for the Horn.
Weigh, hey, roll and go!
Our boot and our clothes, boys, are all in the pawn
To be rollicking randy dandy O!

Heave a pawl, oh, heave away
Weigh, hey, roll and go!
The anchor's on board and the cable's all stored
To be rollicking randy dandy O!

Soon, we'll be warping her out through the locks
Weigh, hey, roll and go!
Where the pretty young girls all come down in their flocks
To be rollicking randy dandy O!

Heave a pawl, oh, heave away
Weigh, hey, roll and go!
The anchor's on board and the cable's all stored
To be rollicking randy dandy O!

Come breast the bars, bullies, heave her away
Weigh, hey, roll and go!
Soon we'll be rolling her down through the Bay
To be rollicking randy dandy O!

Heave a pawl, oh, heave away
Weigh, hey, roll and go!
The anchor's on board and the cable's all stored
To be rollickking randy dandy O!
